# Cross browser testing with non-functional tests

Ensuring [cross browser compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-browser_compatibility) 
is a [non functional requirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement) 
(NFR). Cross browser requirements do not define the application's behavior but 
defines where the application will be used.

> A [functional requirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement) 
defines what a system is supposed to do. A NFR specifies criteria that can be used 
to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors. 
- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement).

In my roles as a developer and tester, I see teams only using automated 
UI tests, originally written to test the functionality, run across browsers to 
ensure compatibility. Here, functional tests are used as a blanket to cover 
the cross browser issues. 

However, after working on [Gauge](https://gauge.org/) and [Taiko](https://docs.taiko.dev/), 
I feel there’s a better and faster way to verify cross browser compatibility.
relying only on functional tests. 

In this post we look at ways to ensure cross browser compatibility without 
relying on functional tests. Not all cross browser compatibility issues are 
caught by functional tests. Here, I want to highlight how teams are using 
alternatives to address them.

## Deal with Non Functional Requirements earlier

From the definition of BDD or Behaviour Driven Development, we know that,

> The plan for implementing non-functional requirements is detailed in 
the [system architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture), 
because they are usually [architecturally significant requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecturally_significant_requirements). 
- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement).

Cross browser requirements have to be taken into account by developers 
before the development begins as it’s architecturally significant.

Most probably everyone uses some kind of framework which already checks 
for compatibility. Javascript frameworks like [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), 
[vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [jquery](https://jquery.com/), and UI frameworks 
like [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) 
test for cross browser compatibility.

Here are a few blogs that talk about the same

* “React implements a totally different DOM system which is independent 
of the browser. The implementation is done to make the application 
cross-browser compatible.” - Cross-Browser Compatibility and React.js Web Apps
* “Vue.js guide to ensure cross browser compatibility” - Browser Compatibility
* “If you are using Twitter Bootstrap, and have been curious enough to 
inspect the core bootstrap.css stylesheet, you will find approximately 
6,000 lines of pure CSS code.  If you delve in deeper and look at the style 
code in detail, you will find how they use multiple tricks and techniques to 
make sure Bootstrap is the most cross browser CSS framework” 
- [cross browser compatibility tips](https://www.monitis.com/blog/cross-browser-compatibility-tips-part-1/)

It is better to invest in the right architecture for your application than 
waiting for issues to be reported.

## Write non functional tests for Cross browser compatibility

To understand what we expect from a cross browser test, let’s analyse how 
the browser is rendered. There are 3 main components to how browser 
rendering works. 

* HTML - handles the static structure of the page
* CSS - is the way we present the information with styles and visual layout 
* Scripts - are used to give behaviour to the UI elements.

{:.specialParagraphTag}
The functionality of the application does is the same across browsers.
To ensure that the application works as expected in the browser/s 
you have to ensure that the CSS, HTML and JavaScript 
works across browsers. 
This can be achieved using static analysis of front end code and does not need 
dynamic analysis.

“Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed 
without actually executing programs, in contrast with dynamic analysis, which is 
analysis performed on programs while they are executing.” 
- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis)

> We can utilise some tools to cross-reference our code against the compatibility 
databases, targeting only the browsers and versions we are interested in. 
- [cross browser testing, without the browsers](https://medium.com/@you54f/reading-time-10-mins-8b6e7ef90062)

Let’s look at visual regression analysis and scripting analysis to understand better!

### Visual regression

The visual regression’s intention is to ensure the app appears as its designers 
intended. Browser automation frameworks used for functional tests ignore layout 
issues or UI regression. 

> Look at this UI. How did this happen in production? My guess is that they have 
test automation for this. But guess what...all of the expected text is there. So, 
the tests are passing because traditional assertions would never catch this. 
- [Tweet by Angie Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6516788025379426305/)

This example may seem exaggerated, but possible, because the functional tests 
pass by performing actions on the structure page (HTML selections using XPath) 
even if there are visual defects or if the app is visually unusable. Clearly 
functional tests do not ensure CSS and HTML browser compatibility. 

Static code analysis reduces visual regression defects. [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/) 
has gained popularity among the front end developers. The [incompatibilities are 
when front-end developers want to adopt new features](https://caniuse.com/#compare=edge+76,firefox+70,chrome+79,safari+TP&compare_cats=JS,JS%20API,Security). 
Especially, when you are not aware of the set of browsers to be supported, we have 
to use features that are tried and tested! 

### CSS Checking with Stylelint, ESLint for CSS

[Stylelint-no-unsupported-browser-features](https://github.com/ismay/stylelint-no-unsupported-browser-features) 
is a plugin that allows configuration of target browser/s and errors are reported 
with the list of browsers that do not support a feature. 
It uses [doiuse](https://github.com/anandthakker/doiuse) to detect browser support. 
[Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) is a [peerdependency](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/) 
of this plugin.

### Scripting

When functional tests are used to ensure cross browser compatibility, it 
increases the amount of time needed to triage and analyse the failures. 

Functional testing tools act as mere aggregators of test results from various 
browsers and leave it up to the end user to get actionable insight. Functional 
tests might tell the test script could not perform an action, but it won't tell 
you the root cause of failure. For instance, it will not tell you that the 
failure is because some scripting feature used in the application code isn’t 
supported by a relevant browser.

To get that specific feedback, plugins like 
[ESLint-plugin-CanIUse](https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-compat#readme) can help. 

### Checking JavaScript with esLint against caniuse db

They allow configuration of target browser/s, percentage of feature supported. 
Errors are reported with the list of browsers not supported and the percentage 
of the feature.

## Impact of standards and consolidation of browsers

In the early days, JavaScript features weren't standardised across browsers like IE and Firefox. We find 
various articles talking about the support for older browsers. There is a lot 
of information available to address these issues.

Testing frameworks were created to specifically target this issue. However, in 
recent times browsers are being standardized. [Polyfills](https://polyfill.io/v3/), 
[shims](http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/an-introduction-to-writing-your-own-javascript-compatibility-shims.html) 
and [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) are only used in projects where old 
browsers are supported. 

But the practice goes on. The processes to handle cross browser compatibility 
are evolving as more browsers are adopting standards. Keep yourself updated and 
use modern approaches. Costs may be associated with moving towards using modern 
approaches. But you have to consider the amount of time, effort, and money taken 
to maintain a traditional scripting style. Choosing/upgrading to the right 
frameworks will eventually benefit the business.

Selenium was designed for cross browser automation and was created to test our 
internal timesheet application across [IE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer) 
and [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/exp/firefox/) when 
[browsers lacked standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars). 

By the time we started to build [Taiko](https://github.com/getgauge/taiko), 
[browser vendors agreed to standards](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/web-standards-guide/). 
With browsers adhering to standards, using functional tests to check cross 
browser compatibility is not just costly, but also redundant!
