# 5 reasons to use Gauge

Despite having the right set of automated tests, writing and managing a growing test suite can be challenging.

Here’s a few other Gauge features that can make managing tests less painful.
> ***Reason 1: Get Started Quickly***

Be it Mac, Windows, Linux OS or any of the supported Gauge’s language runners, all it takes is [5 steps](https://docs.getgauge.io/quickstart.html#) from Gauge installation to see it work. There are [*templates](https://docs.getgauge.io/using.html#gauge-project-templates) *available to bootstrap the process of initialising a Gauge project. Read about some of the [examples](https://docs.getgauge.io/examples.html) to understand more.
> ***Reason 2: Easy to use***

With Gauge, stop worrying about

***Which* **language is used to implement a *step *— Java, C#, Ruby or community contributed [*runners](http://getgauge.io/plugins.html)*

***When ***to execute — Trigger the tests manually or Configure to Auto trigger

***Where ***to execute it from — CI/locally on Windows, Mac or Linux, Virtual Machine, Docker Container.

***What ***are the types of test data used for the test cases — external/internal, inline/[*special](https://docs.getgauge.io/longstart.html#special-parameters)* and more

**How** are the tests executed — In Sequence or in [*parallel](https://docs.getgauge.io/using.html#parallel-execution)*.

Gauge’s *execution *and [*reporting](https://docs.getgauge.io/reports.html) *handles all this and more.
> ***Reason 3: Get faster feedback***

Gauge is fast. Here are the performance numbers on a micro bench mark of a sample Gauge project.

***With [multithread](https://docs.getgauge.io/using.html#parallel-execution-using-threads) parallel run, the performance gains are huge**.*

All other functionalities like reporting etc. just works on either mode. It is easy to switch between sequential of [*parallel](https://docs.getgauge.io/using.html#parallel-execution) *runs for your test suite. This makes configuring Gauge test suites, to run on CI/CD servers, simple.
> ***Reason 4: Better abstraction***

[*Specifications in Markdown](https://blog.getgauge.io/why-write-tests-in-plain-text-d9a54ccdc41b)* provides an effective way to break communication barriers and express better. It cleanly abstracts code behind the [*steps](https://docs.getgauge.io/longstart.html#steps)*.

*A [Concept](https://docs.getgauge.io/longstart.html#concepts) *is a re-usable logical group of *steps*. It allows better abstraction of a business intent by combining *steps*.

*Flexible folder structure* gives the ability to locate and [*execute](https://docs.getgauge.io/using.html#specify-directories) *the specifications that interest us.

[*Tagging](https://docs.getgauge.io/using.html#tagged-execution) *allows to define functional and logical groups across scenarios and specifications. [*Filter](https://docs.getgauge.io/reports.html#export-to-html)*, [*execute](https://docs.getgauge.io/using.html#tagged-execution) *and [*search](https://docs.getgauge.io/reports.html#spectacle)* related scenarios and specifications easily using these tags.
> ***Reason 5: IDE Support makes maintaining suites easy***

With a growing test suite, there is a need to make managing it simpler. Gauge’s [IDE support](https://docs.getgauge.io/using.html#id7) helps to

* Navigate between *steps*, *concepts* and [*code blocks](https://docs.getgauge.io/language.html#step-implementations)*. This helps to keep the flow & get better understanding.

* Autocomplete encourages **D**on’t want to **R**epeat **Y**ourself (DRY)

* Generate [*step](https://docs.getgauge.io/longstart.html#steps) *implementations

* Refactor with ease

* Early warnings (displays as you type)

* Run tests from the IDE at any level — suite, *spec*, *scenario* etc.

* Debug your tests from the IDE

* [And more!](https://docs.getgauge.io/using.html#id7)

At [*Gauge](http://getgauge.io/)*, we understand that it is good to keep things simple. We aim to make test automation, simple and easy to maintain*.*
